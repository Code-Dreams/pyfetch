# pyfetch
A WIP port of neofetch to python.

You can run it by just doing python pyfetch.py. You could also compile it with cython by running compile.sh, for compiler optimizations and speed improvements.

What is working:
1. Linux os name fetching
2. Bedrock linux support (OS recognition and logo)
3. Shell name
4. Computer model
5. CPU
6. Screen resolution
7. ALL (linux) package manager support (supports the same linux package managers as neofetch)
8. Terminal emulator
9. Shell version (fish and bash)
10. Uptime
11. Kernel version
12. Logo printing support
13. Hostname support
14. Desktop environment
15. WM (mutter)
16. Text colors
17. Memory
18. GPU
19. Shell version
20. Battery
21. macOS support

TODO (in order of importance):
1. The colored boxes at the bottom
2. icons, themes, WM, etc
3. Add more logos
4. Windows support
